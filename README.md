Surface Mount Technology (SMT) implementation of Ben Eater's 8-bit Computer

The "M1" project is a Surface Mount Technology (SMT) implementation of [Ben Eater's 8-bit computer project](https://eater.net/8bit) as a compact and modular kit designed in Autodesk Eagle.   If you don't want to mess with SMT or Eagle, Ben has made his kit PCB available in KiCAD already,  or consider purchasing his kit.

For this implementation, I have re-entered all of the design files and created new suirface-mount library components into Eagle, by hand.  Therefore there are likely to be a few errors or unexpected differences encountered. Your feedback would be much appreciated.
